Welcome! :wave:

I am a PhD student in the joint Economics & Finance PhD program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a SSHRC Doctoral Fellow. Previously, I worked as an Analyst at the Bank of Canada. I graduated from the University of Toronto in 2018 with an Honours Bachelor of Arts in Economics and from the University of Texas at Austin with a Master of Science in Data Science. I received the Bank of Canada's Women in Economics Scholarship in 2020. 

Above all else, I am an avid traveller. Iceland is next on my bucket list. I am currently reading [Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/empire-of-pain-the-secret/0385697546-item.html) by Patrick Radden Keefe, and I am always looking for good book recommendations.
