Welcome! :wave:

I am an Analyst at the Bank of Canada. I graduated from the University of Toronto in 2018 with an Honours Bachelor of Arts in Economics. I received the Bank of Canada's Women in Economics Scholarship in 2020. I am currently completing a Master of Science at the University of Texas at Austin, Department of Computer Science. 

Above all else, I am an avid traveller. I last visited Ireland and Northern Ireland back in November 2019. Next, I'd like to visit Iceland. I am currently reading **[Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/empire-of-pain-the-secret/0385697546-item.html)** by Patrick Radden Keefe, and I am always looking for good book recommendations.
